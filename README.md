The information available here may NOT provide the full picture and only represent a perspective from what is observed from the data. The data sources were created by humans and we all make mistakes, especially under pressure.

However, it does provide guidance to asking good questions when requesting more SPECIFIC information.

Some questions we could ask are:
- How many of the items were purchased and what was the cost per item? Is it realistic?
- In the case of computer hardware and equipment, what are the specifications of the hardware vs price.
- What happens/ed to the material when the mobile clinics shuts down? Is it even tracked via an asset register?
- How long did some of the equipment last? So what quality was the equipment? Bet we can get quite a bit of product reviews.
- Why does so many MAAA's not have shops that is easily found on Google? Who are their suppliers to cover these huge amounts of orders?
- Are there and how much are the fluctuations in item prices? Why are there no volume discounts?
- Which of these MAAA's actually have licenses to sell medical equipment?

It is always good to look for answers in the persuit to learn and education.

But, Don't Be A Troll
